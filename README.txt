API Integration:

Uses fetch() to send text to a translation API and receive translated text.

Handles JSON requests and responses with JSON.stringify() / JSON.parse().

Asynchronous Programming:

Uses async/await to wait for API responses without blocking the UI.

Event Handling:

Captures user actions like button clicks and text input using addEventListener.

DOM Manipulation:

Updates translated text dynamically on the page using document.getElementById() or querySelector().

Error Handling:

Uses try/catch to manage network or API errors and show meaningful messages.

Enhancements (Optional but impressive to mention):

Dropdown for language selection, loading spinner during API calls, and support for multiple translation APIs.
